**PowerCO: factors influencing customer churn using machine learning**

This project addresses a real-world challenge faced by Powerco, New Zealandâ€™s leading dual-energy distributor. The company seeks to better understand the factors contributing to customer churn, with a particular emphasis on how pricing dynamics influence customer behavior. The insights gained aim to inform strategies for customer retention and optimized pricing.

**Key concepts**

This project leverages a range of machine learning methods to explore and predict customer churn. These methods are categorized as follows:

- Unsupervised: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical clustering, K-means
- Supervised linear models: Logistic regression, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Generativa Additive Models (GAMs), Classification 
- Supervised non-parametric classification methods: K-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Other supervised models: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Bagging, random forest, Boosting, CGBoost

In order to run the code, some files had to be updated in an external cloud [here](https://mega.nz/folder/zNV2zCAR#_D_spUczmp_YCJ9jc6oLiA).
